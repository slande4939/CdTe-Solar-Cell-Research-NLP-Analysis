Advancing Photovoltaic Efficiency: Computational Linguistics and Ontological Analysis in CdTe Solar Cell Research

# Abstract
This investigation harnesses computational linguistics to dissect the intricate semantic landscape of CdTe solar cell research. Employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Doc2Vec modeling, the study analyzes and structures a corpus of scholarly articles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering are then applied to reveal thematic clusters and illuminate the semantic architecture of the literature. Enhanced with comprehensive visual analytics, this analysis validates the thematic alignment within the dataset and unveils complex semantic interconnections, offering novel insights into photovoltaic research. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a scientific domain, contributing to the enhancement of photovoltaic efficiencies and underscoring the potential of computational methods to elucidate complex patterns in textual data, thereby advancing solar energy technologies towards sustainability.
